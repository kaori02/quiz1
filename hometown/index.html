          <h1>About My Hometown</h1>
          <br>
          <p>Hi, Let me introduce you to my lovely hometown! </p>
          <p>This is Jambi. The place where I was born, the place where I grow up into the person I am today. Jambi is a beautiful city with very pleasant and friendly people.</p>
          <p>Let me tell you a little bit of Jambi's history. Jambi as a residential area or population concentration even as the center of government position has been running from time to time. The history of the Sung Dynasty describes that the Maharaja San-fo-tsi (Swarnabhumi) resided in Chan-pi . A messenger from Chan-pi arrived for the first time at the palace of the Emperor of China in 853 AD. The second envoy also came in 871 AD. This information shows that Chan-pi (who was identified by Prof. Selamat Mulyana as Jambi) has appeared on the Chinese news in those years. Thus Chan-pi or Jambi already existed and was known in the 9th century AD. News China Ling Pio Lui (890-905M) also mentioned Chan-pi (Jambi) sent a trade mission to China.</p>
          <p>The lineage of the kings of Jambi, written by Ng Lebih Suto Dilago Priayi Rajo Sari, a superior from the Jambi kingdom, who was 12 nationals, wrote Putri Selaro Pinang Masak, the son of rajo, who came down from Pagaruyung, which was king in Jambi. From the designation of Pinang in Javanese (Sundanese), it is called Jambe so that it is suspected by many people as the origin of the word Jambi. So there is a change in sound and letters from Jambe to Jambi. This identification informs that the word Jambe-Jambi was born in the 15th century, namely during the reign of Princess Selaro Pinang Masak in the Jambi kingdom in 1460-1480.</p>
          <p>Raden Syarif (who was later re-revealed by Datuk Sulaiman Hasan) from “The History of Tanjung Jabung Negeri Lamo” noted that Puteri Selaro Pinang Masak took turns from Mangun Jayo to Tanjung Jabung guided by a pair of large ducks (Angso Duo) who were still selected on the 28th May 1401. Legend of Tanahilih is different from Ngebi Suto Dilago. The lineage of the kings of Jambi mentions Orang Kayo Hitam (one of the sons of Selaro Pinang Masak and Ahmad Barus II / Paduko Berhalo) who took turns following a pair of besak ducks (Angso Duo) on the advice of his father-in-law's advice, Temenggung Merah Mato Raja Air Hitam Pauh.</p>
          <p>Professor Moh. Yamin identified Jambi as being near the Jambi Governor's Office in Telanaipura now. This indication is on the basis of starting from the area of ​​the Great Mosque of Al-falah to Pematang, on the edge of Lake Sipin, there are rows of temple brick structures which among them show a large enough temple complex in the area of ​​the village of Legok.</p>
          <p>It is possible that the discovery of select land by a pair of mupurous Angso is the reopening of Chan-pi City, which was abandoned because the Swarna-Bhumi kingdom (San-fo-tsi) was attacked by Singosari in the Pamalayu incident in 1275 AD and moved to the interior of Batang Hari which later became known as Darmasraya (West Sumatra). Two Malay / Darmasraya daughters, namely Dara Petak and Dara Jingga, were brought by Mahisa Anabrang to Singosari in 1292. It turned out that at that time Singosari had collapsed by rebels and then received an attack by Khu Bilaikhan's army. Singosari changed to Majapahit with its King Raden Wijaya. One of the descendants of the Malay Princess, namely from the Dara Jingga pair, Adityawarman, returned to Darmasraya and then founded and became the King of Pagaruyung (1347-1375M). His son, Ananggawarman, continued the Pagaruyung kingdom. One of Ananggawarman's descendants is Puteri Selaro Pinang Masak, which was sold in Jambi.</p>
          <p>After the Orang Kayo Hitam was planned, the center of the kingdom was moved from Ujung Jabung to Tanah Select Jambi around the beginning of the 16th century. Jambi became the seat of government again.</p>
          <p>Prince Depati Anom, who ascended to the throne of the Jambi kingdom with the title Sultan Agung Abdul Jalil (1643-1665M), once gave a permit to establish a market for buying and selling in Muaro Sungai Asam to a Dutch named Beschseven. The Sultan's permit was dated 24 June 1657 where the permitted location then moved from Muaro Sungai Asam to around Muaro Sungai under the current Batang Hari WTC area.</p>
          <p>Jambi as the center of settlement and the seat of the king continues. The palace that was built on Tanahilih Hill was called the last Tanahilih palace as the place where Sultan Thaha Saifuddin was born and appointed as the sultan in 1855. The Tanahilih Palace was then scorched by Sultan Thaha in 1858 following the Dutch army counterattack because of the Sultan and his Commander. Raden Mattaher attacked and managed to sink 1 Dutch warship Van Hauten in the waters of the Muaro Sungai Kumpeh.</p>
          <p>From the ruins, the Tanahilih Palace was controlled by the Dutch and used as the headquarters for Dutch soldiers. Practically after Sultan Thaha Saifuddin fell on April 27, 1904, the Dutch completely placed the Jambi kingdom as part of the Dutch East Indies colonial territory. Jambi then had the status of Under Afdeling under Afdeling Palembang. In 1906 Under Afdeling Jambi was upgraded as Afdeling Jambi then in 1908 Afdeling Jambi became Jambi residency with OL Helfrich residing in Jambi. Until the Independence period, the Resident official from the Jambi residency resided in Jambi. After the Republic of Indonesia was proclaimed on August 17, 1945, based on the Republic of Indonesia News Year II No. 07 page 18 is recorded for the time being that the territory of the State of Indonesia is divided into 8 Provinces, each of which is headed by a Governor including the Province of Sumatra. In 1946, Sumatra Province was further divided into 3 sub provinces, namely North Sumatra Sub Province, Central Sumatra Sub Province and South Sumatra Sub Province. The residency of Jambi with the voting results was transferred to the Central Sumatra Sub Province.</p>
          <p>The first resident of Jambi during the Republican era was Dr. Asyagap as stated in the Government announcement regarding the appointment of residents, mayors in Sumatra based on the decree of the Governor of Sumatra dated 03 October 1945 No. 1-X.</p>
          <p>In 1945, according to Law no.1 of 1945, the territory of Indonesia consisted of provinces, residences, municipalities and cities. The seat of the Resident who has met the requirements is called a City without a City Government structure. Thus, Jambi City as the seat of the Resident of Jambi does not have the status and has its own government. Jambi City was just recognized as a government established by the Governor of Sumatra No. 103 in 1946 dated 17 May 1946 as the Big City and its first Mayor was Makalam.</p>
          <p>Referring to Law No. 10 in 1948 Kota Besar became City of Praja. Then based on Law No. 18 of 1965 became the City of Madya and based on Law no. 22 of 1999 Kota Madya changed to Jambi City Government until now.</p>
          <p>By Law No. 19 of 1958 The residency of Jambi as part of the Province of Central Sumatra was confirmed as Jambi Province which was domiciled in Jambi. At the time of its establishment, Jambi City had the status of a City of Praja with its Mayor R. Soedarsono.</p>
          <p>The date of the determination of Jambi City as the City of Praja which has its own Government as the City Government with the decree of the Governor of Sumatra No. 103 of 1946 dated 17 May 1946 was elected and stipulated by the Jambi City Regional Regulation No. 16 of 1985 and legalized by the Decree of the Governor of the Jambi Region No. 156 of 1986, 17 May 1946 as the anniversary of the Jambi City Government.</p>
